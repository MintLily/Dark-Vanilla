# How to
This is meant to be used for Portainer (Business Edition), with Dark Mode Theme enabled, and with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)<br>
I am not too sure how it'll look on Community Edition, but that me be fixed soon.

Simply open the [style.css](https://github.com/MintLily/Dark-Vanilla/blob/main/Portainer/style.css) file > Import with Stylus and Name it whatever you'd like (Probably **Dark Vanilla**)<br>
You'll need to change the target URL, since mine is being self-hosted on my local network.
